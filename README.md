Welcome to Structures!
------------------------
Structures is a nice compilation of abstract data structures that we could think of! Since its inception, it is growing slowly into a mangnificent collection of ADT journal. We have written the intuition behind developing each structure in its code as introductory code block with algorithm analysis and its merits and de-merits.

The de-merits of one ADT leads to the motivation of creating another ADT, so you will find it like a chain story to browse :P

How to run?
----------------
Structures is a shadow of java project created in eclipse, it contains an in-house developed framework to run test suites. In order to run it on you machine, clone the repo and import the project in your IDE.
